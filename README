A toy implementation of SLAM written while livestreaming.

Usage:

D2D=1 D3D=1 ./slam.py <video.mp4>

Uses:
* SDL2 for 2-D display
* cv2 for feature extraction
* pangolin for 3-D display
* g2opy for optimization (soon!)

TODO:
* Add optimizer for F
* Stop using essential matrix for pose estimation once you have a track
** Add kinematic model
** Run g2o to only optimize the latest pose
* Add search by projection to refind old map points
